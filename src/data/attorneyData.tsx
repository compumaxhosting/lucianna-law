        NANCY E. LUCIANNA is a proud second-generation trial attorney. She
        apprenticed under the supervision of her father, Frank P. Lucianna, the
        “Dean of the Criminal Bar in Bergen County, New Jersey.” Growing up a
        Lucianna, she spent family weekends visiting state prisons and listening
        to her father prepare for battle with prosecutors. <br /> <br />
        After watching trials at age seven, NANCY E. LUCIANNA continued on her
        legal career path by working in the family firm where she was taught the
        nuts and bolts of criminal and civil litigation. More importantly,
        though, she learned how to listen to clients needs and fight
        passionately for their rights without hesitation.

          presentation in court is an absolute necessity. <br /> <br />

          1983 from Fordham as an undergraduate with a double major in political
          science and economics. <br />
          <span className="text-lightBlue">
            When she is not in court, NANCY E. LUCIANNA enjoys running, fitness
            training, scuba diving, deep-sea fishing and is certified in boat
            operation and handling.
