        If you want to sue the police in New Jersey, you better file a Notice of
        Claim 90-days from the date you were wrongfully arrested or injured, NOT
        90-days after your release from custody or after charges against you
        were dismissed. <br /> <br />
        Too many clients contact me with very serious civil rights cases against
        the police but have lost their right to sue because they were
        erroneously informed that they have 90 days to file a Notice of Claim
        against the police after they are released from custody or 90 days after
        they are cleared of related criminal charges. <br /> <br />
        In the State of New Jersey, there is the Torts Claims Act which requires
        that as a prerequisite to filing a lawsuit, the Plaintiff or Claimant
        file with the Municipality, State or other State agency, a Notice of
        Claim within 90 days from the date of the false arrest or the date that
        a person was beaten by the police. This is called the accrual date of
        the running of the 90-day deadline.

        Many individuals are under the mistaken impression that they can talk
        their way out of an arrest. No. You can’t. Once the police have you in a
        position where they are sitting down to speak with you, it is because
        they already have the evidence and have every intention to arrest you.
        You are not going to change their minds or convince them of anything.
        The only intention on speaking with a suspect is to provide the
        confession that ices the cake of the prosecution. <br /> <br />
        The police will likely present you with a Miranda form, which spells out
        all your rights to an attorney and not to speak with the police, and
        most people will sign this form simply thinking they are just
        acknowledging that those rights were provided to them. HOWEVER, what
        most people fail to realize, is that at the bottom of that same form,
        the signature actually states: <br /> <br />
        “I, _______________________, have read the above statement of my rights
        and they have also been read to me. I understand what my rights are. I
        am now willing to answer questions without the presence of an attorney.“
        <br /> <br />
        Do not sign this form as you are not simply signing that you understand
        your rights, but also agreeing to speak to the police. There is no rule
        or law stating that anyone must sign this “acknowledgement.” Simply
        state you will not proceed without an attorney. <br /> <br />
        Zip it. Zip it. Zip it. Take it from Willy the Wahoo, opening your trap
        will just end you up mounted on someone else’s wall.

        Ever receive a Summons and Complaint served on you or a household member
        for something completely bogus? Did you ever come home to find a Civil
        Complaint naming you for something you could not have possibly done?
        Well, if you do nothing or just throw it in your pile of mail to be
        forgotten, that bogus Complaint will become a reality in thirty-five
        days and in all likelihood, you will be forced to pay a debt that you
        believe is not your responsibility.
        <br /> <br />
        New Jersey law requires you to take action within thirty-five days of
        being served with a Civil Complaint. The action you must take is to file
        an Answer with the court that the action is filed in. If you fail to do
        so within the required time, the court will enter default judgement
        against you and the “bogus” Complaint will be enforced, and you will be
        required to pay whatever amount the Complaint asked for. This applies
        even if you were not served personally with the Complaint, but rather it
        was left with any household member over the age of fourteen.
        <br /> <br />
        So don’t avoid your mail! Don’t look at something and say “that’s
        ridiculous!” You must respond to these civil suits and come in to see us
        so that an Answer can be filed with the court in order to protect your
        rights. Post navigation

        By Nancy Lucianna of Law Offices of Nancy E. Lucianna, P.C. on Tuesday,
        February 28, 2017.
        <br /> <br />
        The new president issued several executive orders that affect
        immigration. All of these can have severe consequences for millions of
        immigrants living in the United States.
        <br /> <br />
        For those immigrants living in the New York and New Jersey area, there
        are several things you should know.
        <br /> <br />
        1. Do not open the door for police or immigration officials unless they
        have a warrant. <br /> <br />
        2. Do not provide any statements to police or immigration officials. You
        have a right to remain silent! <br /> <br />
        3. Do not run. You can use your phone to record any raid or take
        photographs, but do not run. <br /> <br />
        4. Ask to speak to your attorney and do not sign ANYTHING. Do not sign
        anything you don’t understand. <br /> <br />
        5. Reckless Driving and Driving on the Revoked List are considered
        Misdemeanor Criminal offences in New York. That means that even if you
        are in the United States with Visa or another lawful status, if you are
        convicted, it could result in deportation proceedings. <br /> <br />
        6. Driving While Intoxicated is considered a criminal offense in New
        York and a traffic offense in New Jersey; however, both carry a risk for
        deportation. <br /> <br />
        7. Driving on the Revoked list due to a DUI offense can be considered a
        felony offense in New Jersey under certain conditions, and could lead to
        deportation even for those with a visa or lawful status. <br /> <br />
        Do not give the police any excuse to pull you over. Driving with tinted
        windows in New Jersey allows the police cause to stop a car, which could
        then lead to more severe consequences. Likewise, speeding or improper
        driving could lead to traffic tickets that may cause serious problems
        for those living in the United States without documentation. DRIVE
        CAREFULLY! <br /> <br />
        The Executive Orders also have directed Immigration Courts to
        speed up any hearings, which could mean that cases previously taking
        years to decide, may now receive quicker attention. <br /> <br />
        While many portions of the Executive Orders concerning immigration are
        under review by various courts, it is essential to know your rights and
        those of your loved ones, despite their visa status in the United
        States. As things change, it is important to have an attorney to guide
        you through the process and not take anything for granted. <br /> <br />
        Call the Law Offices of Nancy E. Lucianna for a consultation if you have
        questions regarding your immigration status.
