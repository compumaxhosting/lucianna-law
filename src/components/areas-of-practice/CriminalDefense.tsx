          Criminal Defense
        </h2>
        <p className="text-white mt-4 text-lg">
          In todayâ€™s criminal justice system, it often seems as though the odds
          are stacked against criminal defendants. Prosecutors have a lot of
          power, and the threat of an especially harsh sentence compels many
          defendants to choose a plea deal rather than going to trial. <br />{" "}
          <br />
          To be sure, a plea deal isnâ€™t always bad. But you should only choose a
          given strategy after consulting with an experienced criminal defense
          attorney. That way, you truly know all of your legal rights and
          options, and you have a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of
          your case. <br /> <br />
          At the Law Offices of Nancy E. Lucianna, P.C., we are here for you and
          will be with you every step of the way. As a results-oriented firm, we
          offer shrewd representation focused on producing the best possible
          outcome for our clients.

          Getting Results Through Collaboration And Thorough Investigation
        </h3>
        <p className="text-white text-lg">
          Our lawyers believe that client collaboration is crucial. You have the
          biggest stake in the outcome of your case, so you should be involved

          and we will seek your input from the beginning. <br /> <br />

          you hire us, the sooner we can get to work conducting our own
          investigation into the allegations. This often includes speaking to
          witnesses and ensuring that evidence is preserved. <br /> <br />
