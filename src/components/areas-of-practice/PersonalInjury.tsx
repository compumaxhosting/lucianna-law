        Personal Injury
      </h2>
      <p className="text-white mt-4 text-lg">
        Accidents happen, and not all misfortunes can be foreseen or prevented.
        That being said, when severe injury or death results from an act of
        negligence, victims and their families have a right to hold the at-fault
        party liable in court.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the Law Offices of Nancy E. Lucianna, P.C., we have decades of
        experience seeking compensation for those who have been seriously
        injured or killed in accidents caused by someone else‚Äôs negligence.
        Common cases include:
      </p>
      {data.map((commonCase) => (
        <Link href={`/personal-injury/${commonCase.slug}`} key={commonCase.id}>
          <div className="flex justify-center items-center bg-mainBrown text-white text-lg mt-4 py-5 w-full px-4 text-center">
            <div>{commonCase.title}</div>
          </div>
        </Link>

        What Should I Do After An Accident?{" "}
      </h3>
      <p className="text-white text-lg">
        What you do or say in the aftermath of an accident could impact your
        ability to seek compensation later on. Here are some general guidelines:
      </p>
      {generalGuidelines.map((guideline, index) => (
        <div
          key={index}
          className="flex items-center text-white text-lg mt-4 w-full"
        >
          <div>üõë&nbsp;{guideline}</div>
        </div>
      ))}

      <p className="text-white mt-4 text-lg">
        Once you have a medical assessment and have discussed your case with one
        of our attorneys, you will have a much better understanding of all your
        rights and legal options.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-white mt-8 mb-2 font-normal">
        Should I Settle Or Go To Trial?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-white text-lg">
        Many personal injuries and wrongful death cases are settled out of court
        before trial. Settling has its advantages, but it may not be worth it if
        the settlement offer is unfair. <br /> <br />
        Our policy is simple: We are always willing to negotiate and consider a
        settlement. But if that settlement is not in your best interests, we are
        fully prepared to take your case to trial in order to fight for the
        compensation you deserve.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-white mt-8 mb-2 font-normal">
        Cases Taken On Contingency: We Only Get Paid If You Do
      </h3>
      <p className="text-white text-lg">
        At the Law Offices of Nancy E. Lucianna, P.C., all of our personal
        injury cases are taken on a contingency basis. We only collect attorney
        fees if we help you win your case or obtain compensation through a
        settlement.
